# Turtle Crossing Game

## Description:
The Turtle Crossing Game is a fun and simple arcade-style game where the player helps a turtle cross a busy road filled with moving cars. Each successful crossing increases the turtle's level, making the cars move faster and the game more challenging.

The game is built using Python and the `turtle` module.

## How to Play:
- Use the "Up" arrow key to move the turtle upwards.
- Avoid the moving cars.
- Each time the turtle reaches the top, it moves to the next level, and the cars move faster.
- If the turtle collides with a car, the game is over.
